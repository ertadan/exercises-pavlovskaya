The nature of Mr. Tostoff’s composition eluded me, because just as it began
 my eyes fell on Gatsby, standing alone on the marble steps and looking from
 one group to another with approving eyes. His tanned skin was drawn attractively
tight on his face and his short hair looked as though it were trimmed every day.
I could see nothing sinister about him. I wondered if the fact that he was not 
drinking helped to set him off from his guests, for it seemed to me that he grew
more correct as the fraternal hilarity increased. When the “Jazz History of the 
World” was over, girls were putting their heads on men’s shoulders in a puppyish,
convivial way, girls were swooning backward playfully into men’s arms, even into
groups, knowing that someone would arrest their falls—but no one swooned backward
on Gatsby, and no French bob touched Gatsby’s shoulder, and no singing quartets 
were formed with Gatsby’s head for one link.
